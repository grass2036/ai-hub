## 📊 Implementation Details

### **Database Schema Created**

```sql
-- 7 Tables with Multi-tenant Architecture:
1. users              - User accounts
2. organizations      - Company/Organization entities
3. teams             - Team structure with hierarchy
4. members           - User-organization relationships
5. budgets           - Financial tracking
6. org_api_keys      - Enterprise API keys
7. usage_records     - Multi-tenant usage tracking
```

### **Key Features Implemented**

#### **Multi-tenant Data Isolation**
- All tables properly linked with foreign key constraints
- Organization-level data segregation
- Team hierarchy support (parent_team_id)
- User membership management

#### **Role-Based Permissions**
- Organization roles: owner, admin, member, viewer
- Permission system with granular access control
- Default permission sets per role
- Custom permission support

#### **Financial Management**
- Monthly budget limits per organization
- Real-time spend tracking
- Alert threshold configuration
- Multi-currency support

#### **API Key Management**
- Organization-scoped API keys
- Rate limiting and quota management
- Key expiration and rotation support
- Secure hash storage

### **Models Created**

#### **Core Architecture**
- **Base Model**: UUID primary keys, timestamps, common methods
- **Organization Model**: Plan types, status management, settings
- **Team Model**: Hierarchical structure, organization linking
- **Member Model**: Role management, permission system

#### **Supporting Models**
- **User Model**: Account management, settings storage
- **Budget Model**: Financial tracking, alert system
- **OrgApiKey Model**: Enterprise API key management
- **UsageRecord Model**: Multi-tenant usage tracking
