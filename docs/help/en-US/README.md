## Billing and Usage

### Understanding Your Bill

#### What You're Charged For

1. **API Requests** - Each call to the API
2. **Tokens** - Text processed by AI models
3. **Storage** - Data storage (Enterprise plans)
4. **Support** - Priority support services

**Pricing Tiers:**
- **Free** - $0/month, 100 requests
- **Developer** - $29/month, 1,000 requests
- **Pro** - $99/month, 10,000 requests
- **Enterprise** - Custom pricing

#### Usage Monitoring

**Check your dashboard for:**
- 📊 **Current month usage** - Real-time usage statistics
- 📈 **Historical trends** - Usage patterns over time
- 💰 **Cost breakdown** - Charges by model and feature
- ⚠️ **Usage alerts** - Notifications when approaching limits

### Usage Optimization

#### Cost-Saving Tips

1. **Choose the right model** - Use simpler models for basic tasks
2. **Optimize prompts** - Be concise to use fewer tokens
3. **Implement caching** - Cache responses to repeated questions
4. **Set limits** - Prevent unexpected usage spikes
5. **Monitor regularly** - Check dashboard frequently

#### Token Optimization

```python
# Before (wasteful)
prompt = "Can you please help me by writing a very detailed and comprehensive explanation of what artificial intelligence is, including its history, current applications, future potential, and the various types of machine learning algorithms?"

# After (optimized)
prompt = "Explain AI: history, applications, future, ML types. Be concise but comprehensive."
```
