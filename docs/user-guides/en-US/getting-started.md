payload = {
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, AI Hub!"}
    ],
    "stream": False
}

headers = {

# Make the request
response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
result = response.json()

## Understanding Usage and Billing

### Usage Metrics

- **Requests** - Individual API calls
- **Cost per Request** - Varies by model complexity
- **Monthly Quota** - Your plan's request limit

### Billing Cycle

- **Monthly Billing** - Charges on the same day each month
- **Pro-rated** - First month billed proportionally
- **Automatic Renewal** - Plans renew automatically
- **Overage** - Extra requests billed at standard rates

### Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Choose the Right Model** - Use simpler models for basic tasks
2. **Optimize Prompts** - Concise prompts use fewer tokens
3. **Monitor Usage** - Check your dashboard regularly
4. **Set Alerts** - Get notified of unusual activity
